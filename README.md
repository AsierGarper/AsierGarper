- 👋 Hi, I’m @AsierGarper, a fullstack developer in .Net Core and Java with a geology background. I have worked as a developer for the last two years doing two coding bootcamps and several training courses in different technologies. 

- 👀 I’m interested to get started in the IT world as a junior fullstack developer and be part of larger projects, which involve a great challenge and where I can test everything I have learned and expand my knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a company project that must comply with the following: Fulfill all client requirements with a maximum of 3 weeks to complete.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in companies that fight for their employees and want them to grow with the company, being able to take on larger and larger projects.
